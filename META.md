Purpose:
These five files define the project’s product scope, technical details, rules, progress, and pending work. Always cross-reference them when producing outputs or making updates.
1.	PRODUCT.md – Product vision & scope: core features, use cases, target users, value proposition.
2.	DESIGN.md – Technical blueprint: architecture, file structure, tech stack, APIs, deployment, integration details.
3.	REGULATION.md – Development rules: coding standards, naming conventions, version control, testing requirements.
4.	PROGRESS.md – Chronological project log: dated milestones, updates, and decisions.
5.	TODO.md – Task tracker: dated actionable items, priorities, and statuses.

Rule:
Any new feature or change should be updated in all relevant META files (e.g., feature → PRODUCT.md + DESIGN.md + PROGRESS.md + TODO.md).
