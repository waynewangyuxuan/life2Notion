# World2Notion: Product Description

## Product Vision
World2Notion aims to make it effortless to capture, organize and archive everything you learn or experience into Notion. Whether you're writing notes in class, snapping a picture of a whiteboard, or recording an audio reflection, the tool reads those inputs, transcribes them accurately and files them in the right place. The goal is to break the cycle of "I didn't log this, so I didn't log anything else" by turning the capture process into a lightweight habit.
